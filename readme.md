# Search Anna's Archive

This is a quick module for searching Anna's Archive. It is not a complete and realable solution, but it is a start.

Works via webscraping, so vulnerable to changes in the website.

## Use

```js
import { search } from "annasarchivesearch";
const results = await search(query);
```
